## Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of car sales data. The goal is to identify sales trends that support informed strategic decision-making. The analysis is presented through interactive dashboards, a presentation, and a Jupyter notebook for the underlying code.

## Process
- Data was scraped from a database using Python (sqlalchemy)
- Data is preprocessed using Python (Pandas and Numpy).
- Analysis and visualization were performed in Power BI.

## Key Insight
- Newer model year, lower mileage, larger engine size increase the price.
- Luxury brands (e.g., BMW, Mercedes) and high-demand models (e.g., Toyota Tacoma) command a significantly higher price due to brand perception and reliability.
- Prices are higher in regions with strong demand and lower supply.
